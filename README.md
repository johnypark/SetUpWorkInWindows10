# SetUpWorkInWindows10
This repository is to trace setting up working environment in R and python for windows 10 machines. 
##### R
- installed microsoft R open
- installed Rstudio
- Loaded project previously ran in Mac: reinstalled package, ggplot2, relaimpo

###### Python
- installed anaconda 
- Installed ubuntu 18.LTS
- command conda and python does not work for ubuntu
- command conda and python works, but fails to load library in windows power shell: Solution: intialized Conda with, 
conda init powershell, after setting PATH. However, this does not work and windows says there is a security issue. 


##### Microsoft visual code ####
- Goal is to use visual code as console to run python and R
- Console result should be displayed on the bottom 
- visual code calls windows powershell, therefore does not run python nor R.
